Hi, I’m Tara Calishain, known throughout the Web as @ResearchBuzz since 1998 or so. 

If I'm known for anything, it's for writing a lot about search engines over the last 25+ years. As the industry has concetrated more on SEO and advertising, I remain focused on the best ways of finding information online, as well as the best way to approach an information collection depending on what I want to get out of it. 
 
 Put another way, I consider the whole of the Internet a fascinating geode, and I'm always thinking about how it would look if I prized it open with different chisels. 
  
I’m currently learning JavaScript and anything else that makes it easier to explore searching online. 

I’m looking to collaborate on absolutely nothing. I'm a completely green noob and of no use to anyone.
